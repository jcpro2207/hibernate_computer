# hibernate_computer
a simple amateur python code that helps to hibernate the computer at set time

p.s idk how to write readme file so it is what it is

# How it works
it uses PySimpleGUI help inform user when it is going to hibernate
i used .pyw as i dont want any console popping up

# How to use
you have to pair with a application launcher like task scheduler for windows to make it automaticly work

# feel free to upgrade or change this code as it is quite goofy ahh!!!
